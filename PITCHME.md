#### What is QV?

Collective decision making rule where participants express how strongly they feel about an issue rather than just whether or not they are in favor.

---

## How does QV work?

@ul[spaced]
* Participants are given budget of "voice credits" (possibly storable).
* Voice credits are spent to influence the outcome of decisions.
* Participant with a strong preference, for or against a decision, can allocate more voice credits.
* Vote pricing rule determines the cost of additional votes in terms of voice credits.
* Each additional vote purchased is increasingly expensive.
